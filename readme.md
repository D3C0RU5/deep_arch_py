## In this example:

### adapters: 
This directory contains the adapters that interact with external entities such as controllers, presenters, repositories, and gateways.

### controllers
It houses the controllers responsible for handling incoming requests and returning appropriate responses.

### gateways
This directory holds the interfaces or abstract classes that define interactions with external systems, such as databases or external APIs.

### presenters
It contains the classes responsible for presenting data to the user interface or other external systems.

### repositories
This directory contains the interfaces or abstract classes that define the methods to access and manipulate data from the underlying data source.

### core
This directory represents the heart of the application and contains the domain logic.

### entities
It includes the domain entities or models that encapsulate the business logic and state of the application.

### usecases
This directory contains the application-specific use cases or interactors, which orchestrate the flow of data between entities and repositories.

### repositories
It houses the concrete implementations of the repository interfaces defined in the adapters layer.

### frameworks
This directory contains the frameworks or libraries used by the application.

### database
It includes the implementation of database-specific code and data access objects.

### web
This directory contains the web framework-specific code, such as routes and middleware.

### ui
It includes the user interface-specific code, such as views or templates.

### main.py
This is the entry point of the application, where the dependencies are wired together and the application is started.

### tests
This directory contains the tests for different layers of the application, mirroring the structure of the source code.

# NOTES
Please note that this is just a simplified example, and the actual structure of your Clean Architecture project may vary depending on the complexity and requirements of your application.
